1)  We are using Expo CLI for our react-native app, normally pro peple use Xcode or 
    Android Studios for App dev, but they are dozens of gb and really heavy to config

    -npx create-expo-app AwesomeProject 
    ( From react-native docs | 
     I was not able to do ./ cuz no files are allowed to be there in the dir, 
     but we had  notes.txt and README.md files ) 

    To run your project, navigate to the directory and run one of the following npm commands.

    - cd temp
    - npm run android
    - npm run ios # you need to use macOS to build the iOS project - use the Expo app if you need to do 
    iOS development without a Mac
    - npm run web


    (Docs have slightly changed since the Vid)
